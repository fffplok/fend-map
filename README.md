# Udacity FEND Project 5: Neighborhood Map Project

### How to use this app:

* Search for any location: enter a city name (Minneapolis is preselected), press enter or click the Go button.
* Meetups are retrieved from Meetup.com and displayed in the search panel. Images retrieved from Flickr.com associated with the location appear in the images panel.
* Each panel may be scrolled.
* Each panel may be minimized and restored, enabling a larger view of the map.
* Markers on the map are displayed for meetup locations. Please note: more than one meetup can have a marker positioned at the same place.
* Clicking on a marker will open up an info window with details about the meetup and highlight the meetup in the search panel. The info window will be positioned optimally between the two panels.
* Clicking on a meetup in the search panel likewise opens up an info window.
* The list of meetups may be filtered by name. Begin typing into the Filter input and the list of meetups and markers will reflect what is matched.
